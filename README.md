## Usage

<!--
```
<custom-element-demo>
    <template>
        <link rel="import" href="proportional-height-box.html">
        <proportional-height-box width="300" height="200">
            <img src="https://placekitten.com/300/200/" />
        </proportional-height-box>
    </template>
</custom-element-demo>
```

<proportional-height-box width="300" height="200">

</proportional-height-box>
```

Width and Height can be any arbitrary values which are used to
create the aspect ratio calculation. You can, for example, use
the original dimensions of the image or video in pixels or the
aspect ratio values such as `16:9` where width is set to `16` and
height is set to `9`.
